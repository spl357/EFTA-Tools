The original release of the Epstein files by the DOJ had files distributed
across sub-directories with 1000 files per directory. The biggest
community assembled archives for the incomplete DataSet 9 flatten these
directories, resulting in over 500,000 files in a single directory for 
DataSet 9. This script unflattens the flattened directory containing the
pdfs for DataSet 9, although it can be used for any of the DataSets.
It will automatically determine how many directories it needs to create
based on the total number of files in the target directory and the batch
size.
